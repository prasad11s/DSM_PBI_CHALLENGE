### **Objective**
The primary objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive and insightful dashboard for the education sector. The dashboard aims to provide a visual representation of key performance indicators (KPIs) in the realm of student enrollment, course completion, average test scores, alumni donation rates, and faculty ratings. By consolidating this information, the dashboard empowers educational leaders and stakeholders with actionable insights for informed decision-making.

### **Stakeholders**

**Academic Administrators:** To assess overall institutional performance, identify trends, and strategize improvements based on data-driven insights.
**Faculty Members:** To gauge their effectiveness through faculty ratings and understand course completion rates.
**Alumni Engagement Teams:** To track donation rates and tailor engagement strategies for alumni.

### **Business Problem**

In the fast-evolving landscape of education, having a centralized platform for tracking and visualizing key metrics is crucial. The business problem we address is the need for a unified dashboard that provides a holistic view of the educational institution's performance, including student metrics, course completion, and alumni engagement. By centralizing this data, we aim to facilitate data-driven decision-making and enhance the overall educational experience.

### **Dataset**
